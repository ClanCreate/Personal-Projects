        <h3>The Art of T5 Kuudra</h3>
        <p>Kuudra is a 4-player instance accessible in the Crimson Isles.
        Players unlock this instance by doing the main quest given by
        Elle when they first enter the Crimson Isles. There are 5 tiers
        of Kuudra that players may unlock by gaining the sufficiant 
        reputation in their faction. This guide will focus primarily on the 
        fifth and last tier of Kuudra. The techniques and know how
        mentioned in this guide may be utilized in lower tiers of 
        Kuudra.</p>

        <h1>Phase 1: Supplies</h1>
            <p>The first part of the Kuudra instance is the supplies phase.
            Players must gather the 6 crates spawned in 7 different areas
            and bring them to the center in order to initiate the build phase.
            The meta for this phase is for each player to start in one of 4
            crate spawning areas. These areas are represented by the symbol on
            the ground near them or structures. 
            e.g. X, /, Tri, =, shop, x-cannon.<!--add images-->
            When the run starts, each player will use their Open Shop to
            purchase the Specialist class and pre-throw their rod to speed
            up the crate gathering process.</p>
            <!--insert example of the initating kuudra phase-->
            <h1>Phase 2: Supplies Part 2</h1>
            <p>Once successful in obtaining the crate, players will place
            their crate in the pile closest to their respective starting spot.
            After players obtain their first crate, they do their following
            2nd crate which is determined by which of the crate didnt spawn
            that run. This is easily noted due to needing to collect 6 crates
            and only having 7 spawning locations. This way, everyone would follow
            an order determined by which crate didn't spawn.</p>
            <h2>Crate Priority</h2>
            <p>Their are a total of 7 possible crate spawning locations;
            /, square, x-cannon, X, shop, Tri, =. Whichever location doesn't 
            spawn a crate, determines which crates each player grabs after 
            obtaining their pre spot crate.<br>
            This chart explains the role of each player by whichever crate
            didn't spawn that run.   
            </p>

            <h1>Phase 3: Building The Ballista</h1>
            <p>After placing all 6 crates, players should head to the closest 
            build pile respective to their pre spot location. Then they
            quickly clear mobs to gain tokens and purchase the highest lvl of build mechanic 
            possible. Should they be unable to purchase Build Mechanic II,
            players should build the ballista until they obtain the tokens
            to purchase the upgrade. The only caveat is if you have Fresh.
            Players with Fresh buff should continue to build for the rest 
            of the phase as it's considered not worth the time loss on Fresh
            to purchase an upgrade to Build Mechanic. Players should stand 
            1 block diagonal of the center of the crate pile. Doing so allows
            the player to look straight down and hype and fire veil whilst
            still shift and left clicking to continue building. Once their 
            first pile is complete, the player should hype to the next pile
            on their half of the build and continue. Should your side be complete
            before the other side, clear mobs attacking your build and go help
            the other side of the build.</p>

            <h1>Stunner Role</h1> <!--change id-->
            <p>Stun should leave build ~92% and proceed to the left cannon facing
            Kuudra. This is due to the cannon animation being slightly faster. Once 
            the stunner is next to the cannon, they should spam buy cannonball in the
            Open Shop until build is done which will enable them to purchase cannonball.
            Once purchased, the stunner should instantly exit Open Shop and left click
            the cannon and aim at kuudra. Once inside kuudra, the stunner should activate
            etherwarp conduit to a designated spot and use the hotm 3 perk pickobulus to
            break the kuudra cell. Once done, stunner should pearl to a designed spot
            in Kuudra to animation skip the death animation and get teleported down
            to the Damage Phase. 
            </p>

            <h1>Phase 4: Stun Phase</h1>
            <p>Once build is complete, all players but stunner will go over
            to the right side facing kuudra and start shooting with at least
            32 toxic arrow poison in their inventory. Toxic arrow poison (tap)
            triggers every tick on kuudra and when kuudra, is stunned, also gets
            the buffed damage which allows for a fast stun phase.</p>

            <h2>Damage buffs</h2>
            <p>Before entering Damage Phase, there are various damage buffs that
            players may utilize to speed up the last round. The most common one 
            is lifeline. Lifeline is an attribute obtained from killing
            the chicken jockey in the crimson isles. The buff gives 25%
            multiplicative damage which drastically improves the parties dps.
            In order to activate the buff, players must be less than 20% hp.
            To lose hp and stay below 20% hp, player utilize various items 
            <!--link to lifeline tools--> and an equip called 
            lava shell necklace; prevents all forms of hp regen. 
            Other forms of damage buffs; <br>
            weirder tuba: buffs all party members by <!--stats--><br>
            Sword of bad health: +100 str for 5s <br>
            SoS flare: +10 ferocity and jalapeno buffs</p>

            <h1>Phase 5: Damage Phase</h1>
            <p>Once kuudra is stunned and defeated, t5 kuudra's unique phase
            starts. All players should rag + reaper instantly after stun phase
            so they get full buffs when they are teleported down and should
            instantly start shooting kuudra till it is defeated.
            </p>
